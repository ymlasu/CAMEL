Curvature Augmented Manifold Embedding and Learning -- CAMEL
=============================================================

**CAMEL** is a Python tool for dimension reduction and data visualization. 
CAMEL can perform unsupervised learning, supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, metric learning, and inverse learning!
CAMEL offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Theoretical background and derivations can be found at `arXiv paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14813>`_.

Software implementation can be found at `Github code <https://github.com/ymlasu/CAMEL>`_.
